Technique uses LPrint on attribute zone to rapidly change colors on the screen. The bitmap remains unaltered all the time. The code has only one Print instruction, used to update the score.

It has in-game music, playing one beep note every 16 frames.

Speed and difficulty increase every 10 seconds and as score gets higher and higher.

Keys:     O move left,          P move right,           M toggle music On/Off


Enjoy!!!!
